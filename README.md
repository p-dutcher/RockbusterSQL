# Rockbuster Stealth Analysis utilizing SQL
### Utilizing SQL queries, I analyze a movie rental company's data in order to answer key business questions and provide meaningful insight and recommendations. Attached are the queries generated, as well as links to the final presentation (in PDF format) and the Tableau workbook used to create the data visualizations.

## Background:
#### Rockbuster Stealth LLC, formerly a brick-and-mortar video rental company, is looking to expand break into the online movie streaming space in order to keep up with market competition and current movie rental trends. In order to do this successfully, some key observations will need to be considered to fully understand global rental trends and sales. 

## Key Questions:
- Which countries have the highest concentration of Rockbuster Customers?
- Where are the highest sales figures geographically?
- Where are the highest value customers located?
- What is the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which movies contributed the most (and least) to revenue gain?

## Data and Tools:
#### The data set (provided by CareerFoundry) was analyzed using PostgreSQL, with visualizations created with Tableau.
