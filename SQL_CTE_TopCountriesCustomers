## The following SQL query utilizes common table expression (CTE) to create a temporary but reusable table in order to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

	(SELECT B.customer_id,
	B.first_name,

	D.city,
	E.country,
	SUM(A.amount) as total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B on A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C on B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D on C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E on D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei',

GROUP BY B.customer_id,D.city,E.country
ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(amount_paid)
